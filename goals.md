# Goals

There are several goals/wishlist items for this project.

Rather than framing it as a "TODO", I think it better to think of these as "wishes". Which are found here to declutter the main readme. They are ordered by some degree priority.
1. Complete Native Demo
2. Integrated and solid Unit tests
3. WASM Demo
4. Installation Guide
5. (others)
	- "Header only" option
	- omit purely passive objects (optimization)

This wonderful tool was used to assist the creation of these markdown files: [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/).

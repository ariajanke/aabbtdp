# Physics Utilities for AABBs
A "minilibrary" for AABB physics for use with personal projects.

## Planned Features
- solidity and collision handling
- AABB vision handling (ach der Ehrgeiz!)

## Present Goals
Get this thing presentable. In which case I need a:
- (portable) demo
- many, many unit tests
- headers need to be thoroughly documented
- example code snippets (in this readme!)
